# Changelog

In this file we keep track of all the major changes so that we're all on the same page. To make everything easier to track, we will use the following versioning system:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

We update the ```MAJOR``` version whenever we make a big change to the code (i.e. adding a Player character / removing an enemy). This helps us keep track of all the major updates. The ```MINOR``` version is added for smaller features (i.e. adding a new attack to an enemy, or adding a new room to the map), while ```PATCH``` is reserved for really small changes like balancing, bug fixes or code refactoring. Below I will add all the changes that occurred with each merge into the main branch.

**Current version:** v1.0.0
